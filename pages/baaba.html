    <h1>Hi I'm Baaba</h1>
    <p>I'm deeply passionate about Natural Language Processing and have a profound appreciation for language continuity, especially when people express themselves in their mother tongue. While I don't often have the opportunity to speak my native language, I find joy in understanding it, which has significantly enhanced my language learning journey. This connection between understanding and learning has become the foundation of my approach to linguistics and cultural preservation.</p>
